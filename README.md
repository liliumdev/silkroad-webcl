# silkroad-webcl

An attempt to make a Proof-of-Concept which connects to Silkroad Online's server in Haxe (compiles to Flash). I don't think we managed to make it work. The implementation of Blowfish crypto was hard to do at that time.

Developed in the beginning of 2010. It's now on github only for archival and educational purposes.
