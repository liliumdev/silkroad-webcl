# silkroad-webcl

An attempt to make a Proof-of-Concept which connects to Silkroad Online's server in Haxe (compiles to Flash). Developed in the beginning of 2010. I don't think we managed to make it work. The implementation of Blowfish crypto was hard to do at that time.

It's now on github only for archival and educational purposes.
